# CSS Snippetry 🧑‍🎨

Parts of my CSS snippet collection for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). The (excluded) rest of them were yoinked, not sure about their licenses. Please let me know if I forgot to give proper attribution but most of this has been put together by myself.

`current` is what I actually, actively use at the moment. Everything else has been archived.
